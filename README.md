# GigPoster

This is a python application designed to pull data from my google calendar and make a post about the event to my facebook page. Currently it is not set up for configuration for other users but rather is hard coded only for me. It is run daily ising cron. Eventually i intend to add many other funtions. This project is intended to serve my learning of writing python.
